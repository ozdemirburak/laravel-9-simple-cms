To install the composer dependencies you need to have composer installed, if you don't have composer installed, 
then [follow these instructions](https://getcomposer.org/download/). Finally run, `composer install` in the `laravel-9-simple-cms` directory.

with fake data. Do not forget that all variables with `DB_` prefixes in your `.env` file relates to your database configuration. 
After configuring your `.env` file, with the proper data, you need to create the assets.

If you do not have node and npm installed, follow one of the techniques explained in this [link](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814).
Then, to install our boilerplate project's asset dependencies, run `npm install`. Finally to combine the

Gmail username without `@gmail.com` and password as your Gmail password, `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` is your 
Gmail account with `@gmail.com` and `MAIL_FROM_NAME` is your name that is registered to that Gmail account.
